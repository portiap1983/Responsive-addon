            <h2>Why Vancouver</h2>
            <h3>Something fun about Vancouver</h3>
            <p>
              Vancouver, a bustling west coast seaport in British Columbia, is
              among Canada’s densest, most ethnically diverse cities. A popular
              filming location, it’s surrounded by mountains, and also has
              thriving art, theatre and music scenes. Vancouver Art Gallery is
              known for its works by regional artists, while the Museum of
              Anthropology houses preeminent First Nations collections.
            </p>
            <p>
              Vancouver is one of the most ethnically and linguistically diverse
              cities in Canada: 49.3 percent of its residents are not native
              English speakers, 47.8 percent are native speakers of neither
              English nor French, and 54.5 percent of residents belong to
              visible minority groups. It has been consistently ranked one of
              the most livable cities in Canada and in the world. In terms of
              housing affordability, Vancouver is also one of the most expensive
              cities in Canada and in the world.Vancouverism is the city's urban
              planning design philosophy.
